PROJECT NAME -: Forest Fire Analysis.
Table of Content-:

*Demo Overview

*Reason to Choose these Project: 
To find out the state in which fire is in large number
to find out the month in which fire occured more
to find out the monthly analysis of fire
to predict the fires in upcoming year.

*Pandas Methods which are used in these project
I used groupby where i need the reference of some other column.
I have used unique method to neglect the copies
I used countplot where the data is more and to visualize it properly.

*Graph which are used : 
Piechart
Lineplot
Bargraph
Catplot

*Workdone
Read and clean the data and formating it.
finding to number of fires in month, year and states
Worst fire hit in top 5 states
analysis on which month catches fire mostly.
Polynomial equation to predict the upcoming year fire analysis

*Conclusion
# 1. February, March, April and May see the lowest number of forest fires
# 2. A sudden spike in June continuing the trend till November
# 3. July, August, October and November are the 4 months where maximum forest fires happen

# 1. Mato Grosso see a huge number of forest fires
# 2. Sergipe, Distrito Federal, Alagoas and Espirito Santo see the lowest number of forest fires

# Fires increased dramatically in the last 20 years, from 20,000 in 1998 to almost double in 2017. 
# What's also alarming is that there is also an increasing trend in the data, 
# so we can expect even more wildfires in the years to follow.
# 2003 and 2016 had the most wildfires throughout Brazil.
